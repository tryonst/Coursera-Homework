<h1>Our Menu<h1>
<h2>Chicken</h2>
<p>Everything tastes like chicken. It's the universal flavor. I don't know how it happened, but it seems like just about everyone's taste buds converge on chicken. This might not be a good thing. I mean, we all know that some plants and animals have evolved a sharp, bitter or unpleasant taste or odor as a defense mechanism. From an evolutionary perspective, it might not be a good idea to have a flavor that mimics something everyone finds tasty. The moral of the story, of course, is simple: don't be chicken!</p>
<h2>Beef</h2>
<p>Where's the beef? That was a line from a commercial for a major fast-food chain many years ago. The idea was to make it seem that customers visiting competitor's fast-food were getting less of a meal when they ordered a hamburger. Nowadays, however, the question has taken on a whole new meaning. That original fast-food chain now serves plant-based protein burgers. Where's the beef?</p>
<h2>Sushi</h2>
<p>A younger person I was working with recently told me she was surprised by how "woke" I was. That's a lot of pressure. I mean, all of a sudden, things I never would have given a second thought make me pause. I think "What would a 'woke' person do in this situation?" Take sushi, for instance. Is that as misogynistic as it sounds? Why do I just assume that all these fish are females? And if some of these rolls are made from male fish, should I call it suhe? Should I order some of both? The 21st century is turning out to be much more challenging than I ever thought possible.
